I want to dedicate this post to my roots and heritage. I grew up in a culinary family, and if there was one dish that brought us together the most, it was pizza. My dad opened Pizza Mia, a takeout restaurant in the Chicagoland area in 1991, at only 19 years old. 34 years later, new locations, new customers, same old approach.

My father didn't just build a restaurant; he created a training ground for life. I started off standing on milk crates, hardly able to reach the counters. Not that I was really working, more so snatching pepperonis from the pizza line with my brother. We'd come in during the morning hours and hang out or work on a task together.

## Lessons From the Kitchen

As I grew older, I quickly learned that being the owner's son meant higher standards, not special privileges. My work was scrutinized more intensely, my mistakes addressed more directly – a tough but invaluable lesson in accountability and excellence.

The teachings learned in that kitchen transcended far beyond the culinary world. The farther I am from the kitchen, the more those skills shine.

Whether it was making a pizza from scratch or delivering it to someone's door, there was a sense of importance and fulfillment that came with it. This isn't something everyone is going to feel, I understand, but in my situation, I could feel the impact the business had on families, friends, and the community. I fell in love with service, being excellent in every way I knew how, and learning in every way I didn't. Such is life.

## The Digital Transition

My journey from the kitchen to technology wasn't as dramatic a shift as it might appear. The fundamental skills – process optimization, problem-solving under pressure, understanding client needs, and maintaining quality standards – transferred seamlessly to this new domain.

I've developed a technical toolkit that complements my small business perspective. My experiences in both worlds have shown me that behind every technical specification lies a human need and a business challenge.

## Building Digital Solutions Today

Currently, I'm focused on creating technology solutions that respect the realities of small businesses. Working with modern frameworks & processes, I build applications that address specific business needs without unnecessary complexity.

I won't dive too deep into the technical jargon in this post, but be sure to check out the technology category of posts for technical writings. You can also see some of the recent projects I've been working on. One includes a full admin suite for a sports organization to manage their players, communications, and public website all in one place.

## The Small Business Advantage in Tech

What sets my approach apart is the convergence of small business understanding and technical expertise. I bring firsthand experience with the constraints, priorities, and realities of running a family business.

I understand that implementing new technology often requires taking valuable time away from core operations and that solutions must provide clear ROI rather than just technical elegance.

## Looking Forward

At 22, I recognize I'm still early in my professional journey. My current corporate IT role provides valuable experience while I continue to develop independent projects and client work that align more closely with my long-term vision.

The philosophies guiding my work aren't complex:

- Deliver honest value
- Respect practical constraints
- Prioritize genuine results over technical sophistication
- Always remember the human needs behind every project

These principles were forged in the heat of a kitchen and refined through education and professional experience.

## Technology That Serves Your Business

Whether you're looking to establish your first real web presence, optimize existing systems, or strategically plan your technology roadmap, my background provides a unique perspective that bridges the gap between traditional business and modern digital solutions.

The path from Pizza Mia to the digital world continues to evolve, but the core ingredients of success remain remarkably consistent.

I believe technology should serve your business, not the other way around. Let's build something that works as hard as you do.
