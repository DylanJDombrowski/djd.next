As a freelance developer, my spreadsheet was my source of truth. It was also my biggest source of frustration. Every day involved remembering to jot down 15-minute tasks, dealing with clunky formulas, and exporting unprofessional-looking PDFs for clients.

### The Tipping Point

I realized I was losing at least **$200 a month** in un-billed tasks. The small interruptions, the quick bug fixes—they all fell through the cracks. That's when I decided to build something better.

I wanted a tool that was:

- **Simple:** Fast enough to log time without breaking my focus.
- **Professional:** Able to generate client-ready reports instantly.
- **Integrated:** Combining time tracking with client management.

That's the mission behind Billable. It’s a tool built out of necessity, for freelancers like me.
